              I write this book in memory of my late father Larry Rogers, who passed away in 2002 succumbing to the side effects of chemotheraphy treatment for a cancer that went undetected for many years.
              <BR><BR>
              This book is a collection, a collage, of the good memories, and sometimes not so good memories, of me and my father, mostly in work and mindset, but occassionally including personal stories as well. 
              <BR><BR>
              I have allowed this book to be digitised and put on the internet since 03 March 2016.
